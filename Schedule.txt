Lectures on satellite data analysis consists of 8 blocks x 2h each.
In each block there are 20min lecture and demonstration followed by hands on exercises.
All participants will need access to matlab on their own (preferentially) or provided computers. 
Project work: deeper focus on satellite data or simulations, or combined work involving both.
